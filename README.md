# Covid-19-India-Dashboard-using-Tableau-
A comprehensive Tableau dashboard visualizing the impact of Covid-19 in India. This project provides insights into case distributions, testing patterns, vaccination drives, and demographic details across Indian states.


1. Dataset Overview
You used multiple datasets to create this comprehensive dashboard:

Covid-19 India data: Confirmed, cured, and death cases.
Age group details: Distribution of cases among different age groups.
ICMR Testing Labs: Number of labs per state.
State-wise testing details: Total tests, positive and negative cases.
Individual details: Gender-based distribution.
Covid vaccine state-wise data: Vaccine doses administered (CoviShield, Covaxin, Sputnik V).

2. Visualization Analysis
Map: Total Deaths by State
Insight: Maharashtra shows the highest number of deaths, highlighted in red. States with fewer deaths are lighter in color.
